The following additions and amendments by M1KTA are implemented
  
    o Adjustments to bands for UK band plans, adding 137KHz & 472KHz, adjusting 60m to bands not channels, adjusting top of 40m, 
    o Amend to use 20x4 LCD so add a line for VSWR, Power Meter and Supply Voltage
    o Need to default 137 and 472 to cw modes only
    o Need to look at the bandwidth constrints vs modes for the 60m sections, all are not the same
