The following circuit should be added to implement a Rotary Encoder and
Multiple Push-Button Switches parallel to the original FN Switch. The original
Tuning POT has been removed to accommodate the Encoder.

Where:
  4K7 is a 4.7K ohm resistor
  47K is a 47K ohm resistor
  FNS is the original FN switch
    S is a new switch
    = is a capacitor
    G is a ground and AGND
  ENC is the Rotary Encoder with Push Button

Note: The Encoder pins A and B, can be exchanged to reverse the Encoders electrical rotation.
